Donald Trump has been an inflammatory figure for much of his time in the public sphere. This phe- nomenon was exacerbated by his presence on Twit- ter, only growing during his presidency from 2017 to 2021 until his banning from the platform in January of 2021. We are interested in whether the nature of his comments – as defined by the sentiments of anger, an- ticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise or trust – had any correlation with the amount of engagement his posts on Twitter received. We anticipated that joy and trust would be the least influential in terms of driv- ing engagement. By the end of our investigation, we determined that joy did in fact have the least impact on engagement, and overall sentiment could be used to predict high or low engagement about 13% more accu- rately than flipping a coin.
